Deployed Page: https://js-ma4.vercel.app/


Create these 3 routes, named exactly:

- "/"
- "/results"
- "/about-us"

Place links to these routes in some kind of nav common to all pages.

All three pages should use a `Heading` component.

### Home page

This page should display a heading and a link to the results page.


### Results page

This page should make a call to your URL and display at least 2 properties from each result.

You can use either static generation or server-side rendering.

If one of the properties you display is an image source, use Next's `Image` component.

### About us page

This page should display a heading and lorem text.
